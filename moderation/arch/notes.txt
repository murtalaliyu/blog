1. user submits a comment to the comments service
2. comments service persists the comment (notably, comment.status is known to be pending)
3. comments service emits a type:"CommentCreated" event to the event bus
4. event bus emits "CommentCreated" event to moderation service and query service
5. moderation service processes (moderates) the comment and emits a type:"CommentModerated" event to the event bus
6. event bus emits "CommentModerated" event only to the comments service. (the comments service will be the only thing that knows how to process this very specialized update to what a comment is)
7. comments service changes comment.status to "approved" and emits a type:"CommentUpdated" event to the event bus
8. event bus emits "CommentUpdated" event to the query service, which updates the existing data in its own store

** query service only listens for 'updated' events **
